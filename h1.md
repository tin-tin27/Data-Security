# Should Tero wear a helmet?
# Summery of Threat Modelling 


 ## X) Threat Modeling:

### Threat model:
Threat Modeling basically process to risk management while analysing system to reflect security concerns and risks about privacy characteristics. In simple words we do threat model to anticipate problems while it stays simple to deal with them before any code written or any final complex structure being executed. 

### Value: 
Finding lackings by collaboration, fixing issues, considering variety of viewpoints, plan primary threat modelling, consistent improvement.

### Principles:  
- [ ] Early and frequent analysis to improve security and privacy of a system
- [ ]  Organisation aligned manageable design that are consequential to the stakeholders
- [ ] Documentation to record the process

### Tends to avoid in Threat Modeling:
- [ ] Relying on any specific individual’s opinion and give them the whole credit
- [ ] Constant analysing instead of looking for solution
- [ ] Over-focusing on partial side
- [ ] Designing only one Fine model

### Instead of these we should follow the patterns to benefit Threat Modeling:
- [ ] Focus on the Big picture
- [ ] Theory into practice
- [ ] Systematic Approach: Attain integrity and reliableness
- [ ] Structured application of security and privacy knowledge
- [ ] Design creatively by including both craft and science
- [ ] Contribution of diverse team members
- [ ] Reach for relevant solution to the problem
- [ ] Diverse viewpoints of experts collaboration
- [ ] Have multiple Threat Models options
- [ ] Enhance productivity with appropriate tools

### Key benefit of Threat Modeling:
- [ ] Early Risk Identification
- [ ] Increased Security awareness
- [ ] Improved system understanding

### Threat Modelling process:
- [ ] System Modeling
- [ ] Threat Identification
- [ ] Response and Mitigations
- [ ] Review and validation

### Challenge Management:
- [ ] Increase Security Knowledge
- [ ] Using tools to enhance workflow
- [ ] Cross team collaboration
- [ ] Guidance from security experts


## A) Security Hygiene: 

### Security Hygiene or Cyber Hygiene: 
Alike human health hygiene practice to maintain good health and not infect others, electronic devices also need to go through Security Hygiene/ Cyber Hygiene to keep the data safe and prevent spreading Cyber risks. In formal definition Cyber hygiene refers to the steps that users of computers and other devices can take to improve their online security and maintain system health. 

### Basic security practices:
- [ ] Regular maintenance: Keeping systems up to date, data back up, using malware softwares.
- [ ] Security Improvement: using strong passwords, multi-factor authentication.
- [ ] Training and awareness: Being cautious of phishing attacks, Securing Wi-Fi networks, cybersecurity programs for everyone in the organisation, encrypt sensitive data.
- [ ] Consistent Effort: Regular monitor effectiveness of security measure and adapting to emerging threats.
- [ ] Collaboration of IT security teams and end users.
- [ ] External assistance: Invest in regular security audits.


### 5 key security hygiene practice every organisation should adapt:
- [ ] Requiring phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent attacks on accounts; Use of conditional access policies and single sign-on (SSO) to streamline the user experience.
- [ ] Implement of Zero trust principles.
- [ ] Deploy modern anti-malware.
- [ ] Continuously updating systems.
- [ ] Ensuring proper access controls for data protection.

## b) Imaginary Company: CloudTeleMed 

### Company Review: 
##### Alike, Business requirements come from business, technical specialist help with tech, here CloudTeleMed is a fictional company specialising in cloud based Telemedicine health care. Their primary product is a comprehensive platform that allows health care providers securely store, access patients health records, providing consumers a secured virtual health care environment without any privacy concern.

### (1) What are we working on?
* Our assets
    #### * Priorization:
    - [ ] Patient’s health data is the highest priority.
    - [ ] Provider’s data is next to the patient’s priority.
    - [ ] Ensuring a secured cloud Health platform is crucial.
   #### * key assets:
    - [ ] Patient Health Data(crown).
    - [ ] Cloud Health Platform.
    - [ ] Health care portal.
    - [ ] Employee data.
    - [ ] Internal Admin Tools.

#### * Security supports business: 
 Security is crucial to CloudTeleMed. Maintaining confidentiality and accessibility of patient’s data is essential to uphold consumer confidence and prevent any kind of consequence.
#### * Diagram of the company systems:  
- [ ] Service providers access system via health care portal.
- [ ] Cloud Health Platform : Data storage, Application servers, Security server.
- [ ] Platform management (tools and observation).

###  Service & Customer View points
  Consumer can access the service via Health care portal, booking appointment, getting instant treatment  through direct interaction, access and update their medical records, run health analytics. They expect to get secured service maintaining their privacy and 24/7 availability.

### (2) What can go wrong?

#### According to STRIDE Model:  
- [ ] Spoofing Identity:
      An attacker can impersonate to be a health care provider to access consumer data.
- [ ] Tampering with Data:
      Attacker can make change in patients health records, endangering patient’s health.
- [ ] Repudiation:
       A health care provider can make unauthorised changes and deny the fact, and there’s no   proof to trace the prohibited operation.
- [ ] Information Disclosure:
      Accessing patient data unauthorisedly.
- [ ]  Denial of Service :
      Disrupting consistent service availability due to DoS attacks.
- [ ] Elevation of privilege:
      The hacker can enter restricted areas and even can destroy the whole system which is very dangerous. 

#### Identified Risks:
- [ ] Unauthorised Access to Patient Data that can highly affect patients treatment and make reputational damage.
- [ ] DoS attack on Cloud health platform and break service chain. It’s considered as high risk cause it affects the service availability.
- [ ] Tampering with health records: Moderate risk, this could make serious damage to patients wellbeing.

#### Threat Actors: 
- [ ] Cybercriminals:
      Can get the access of consumers data through phishing attacks. Financial intentions.
- [ ] Hacktivists:
      Can target CloudTeleMed due to ethical issues with other healthcare companies. Generally not motivated by money. Instead, they have a burning rage inside them leading to acts of cyber vandalism.
- [ ] State-Sponsored Attacks:
      Primarily can target critical infrastructure to cause service  availability disruptions, safety risks, and economic damage to the company. State-Sponsored attacks are far less common than cybercriminals and hacktivism, but they are one of the main threat actors. And they don’t any direct financial intention.
- [ ] Insider Threats:
      Risk of any authorised health care provider abuse their access and it’s not clearly detectable. These are mostly done by Malicious Insiders(deliberate abuse with intention of episonage or financial gain)

#### Business continuity:
We have to keep serving the customer to receive money. Trust is crucial among stakeholders to work successfully. Trust is hard to get and easy to lose. CloudTeleMed must ensure consistent access to cloud health platform and provide secured service. A minor breach can lead to loss of consumer trust and significant financial mace.

### (3) What are we going to do about it?

#### Reduce attack surface:
       Implement MFA. 
       Regular updating. 
       Segment Networks.
 #### Limit entry points:
       Restrict Access only to authorised users.
       Employ WAF to protect from web based attacks.
        
#### META:
 ##### Mitigate: Take action to reduce the likelihood of threat attacks.
 ##### Eliminate: Simply remove the component that is causes security risks.
 ##### Transfer: Shift responsibility to another entity such as the customer.
 ##### Accept: Mitigating, eliminating, or transferring the risk are usually not accepted.

### (4) Did we do a good enough job?
 #### Regular Security audits.
 #### Pentests: Periodic penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities.
 #### Continuous threat modeling: Implement regular monitoring.
 #### Assesments or Evaluation: Feedback from patients to ensure security level meets their criteria.

### Process: 
Security of CloudTeleMed is not a one time job. The company must continue to adapt its threat modeling and security hygiene practices. It never ends, It is an ongoing process to ensure continued success of the CloudTeleMed Company.
