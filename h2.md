# h2 Kill chain

## This context introduces the concept of Advanced Persistent Threats (ATPs)  and discuss the limitations of traditional network defense methods in addressing them.

## Background on Networking Threats:

•	Malicious users have been attempting to take advantage of lacking.
•	Early threats were self-propagating.
•	Anti-malware helped preventing the risk of automated threats.

## Network Defense system:

•	Focus on vulnerabilities and predicts successful intrusion before response.
•	Insufficient tools to defend ATPs.
•	It’s often assumed that the response should happen after system has already been compromised due to system flaws.
•	Dealing with APTs requires a more proactive defense strategy which focus on attacker’s actions and intentions.

## Kill chain Model: 

Proactive approach to cybersecurity by deconstructing the attack process into identifiable and disruptable ways.

## Phases of Kill chain: 

1.	Reconnaissance : Research on target.
2.	Weaponization : Preparing malware to exploit specific vulnerabilities.
3.	Delivery : Transmission of malware to the target.
4.	Exploitation : Activation of malware exploiting system flaws to get access.
5.	Installation : Establishment of access backdoor to presistence inside the certain network.
6.	Command and Control (C2) : Eshtablishment of the C2 channel netwrok that allows attackers to have direct control over the compromised system.
7.	Actions on Objectives : The attacker achive their ultimate goal by data stealing or disrupting operations within the target environment.
